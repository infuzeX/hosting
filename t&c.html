No Spam. We do not tolerate the transmission of spam. We monitor all traffic to and from
our web servers for indications of spamming. Customers suspected to be using our products
and services for the purpose of sending spam are fully investigated. If we determine there is
a problem with spam, we will take the appropriate action to resolve the situation.
We define spam as the sending of Unsolicited Commercial Email (UCE), Unsolicited Bulk
Email (UBE) or Unsolicited Facsimiles (Fax), which is email or facsimile sent to recipients as
an advertisement or otherwise, without first obtaining prior confirmed consent to receive
these communications. This can include, but is not limited to, the following:
1. Email Messages
2. Newsgroup postings
3. Windows system messages
4. Pop-up messages (aka "adware" or "spyware" messages)
5. Instant messages (using AOL, MSN, Yahoo or other instant messenger programs)
6. Online chat room advertisements
7. Guestbook or Website Forum postings
8. Facsimile Solicitations
9. Text/SMS Messages
We will not allow our servers and services to be used for the purposes described above. In
order to use our products and services, you must not only abide by all applicable laws and 
regulations but you must also abide by this no spam policy. Commercial advertising and/or
bulk emails or faxes may only be sent to recipients who have “opted-in” to receive
messages. They must include a legitimate return address and reply-to address, the sender's
physical address, and an opt-out method in the footer of the email or fax. Upon request by
us, conclusive proof of opt-in may be required for an email address or fax number.
If we determine the services in question are being used in association with spam, we will redirect, suspend, or cancel any web site hosting, domain registration, email boxes or other
applicable services until customer responds. The registrant or customer will be required to
respond by email to us stating that they will cease to send spam and/or have spam sent on
their behalf. In the event we determine the abuse has not stopped after services have been
restored the first time, we may terminate the hosting and email boxes associated with the
domain name in question.
We encourage all customers and recipients of email generated from our products and
services to report suspected spam. Suspected abuse can be reported by email
hosting@infuzex.in.

believe, in our sole and absolute discretion, is transmitting or is otherwise connected with
any spam or other unsolicited bulk email.

15. DISCONTINUED SERVICES; END OF LIFE POLICY
Infuzex reserves the right to cease offering or providing any of the Services at any time, for
any or no reason, and without prior notice. Although Infuzex makes great effort to maximize
the lifespan of all its Services, there are times when a Service we offer will be discontinued
or reach its End-of-Life ("EOL"). If that is the case, that product or service will no longer be
supported by Infuzex, in any way, effective on the EOL date.
Notice and Migration. In the event that any Service we offer has reached or will reach EOL,
we will attempt to notify you thirty or more days in advance of the EOL date. It is your
responsibility to take all necessary steps to replace the Service by migrating to a new Service
before the EOL date, or by entirely ceasing reliance on said Service before the EOL date. In
either case, Infuzex will either offer a comparable Service for you to migrate to for the
remainder of the term of your purchase, a prorated in-store credit, or a prorated refund, to
be determined by Infuzex in its sole and absolute discretion. Infuzex may, with or without
notice to you, migrate you to the most up-to-date version of the Service, if available. You
agree to take full responsibility for any and all loss or damage arising from any such
migration.
No Liability. Infuzex will not be liable to you or any third party for any modification,
suspension, or discontinuance of any of the Services we may offer or facilitate access to.
16. FEES AND PAYMENTS
You acknowledge and agree that your Payment Method will be charged and processed by
Infuzex Ventures Pvt. Ltd.
(A) GENERAL TERMS, INCLUDING AUTOMATIC RENEWAL TERMS
You agree to pay any and all prices and fees due for Services purchased or obtained at this
Site at the time you order the Services. All prices and fees are non-refundable unless
otherwise expressly noted in the Refund Policy section below, even if your Services are
suspended, terminated, or transferred prior to the end of the Services term. Infuzex
expressly reserves the right to change or modify its prices and fees at any time, and such
changes or modifications shall be posted online at this Site and effective immediately
without need for further notice to you. If you have purchased or obtained Services for a
period of months or years, changes or modifications in prices and fees shall be effective
when the Services in question come up for renewal as further described below. Except as
prohibited in any product-specific agreement, you may pay for Services by utilizing any of
the following “Payment Methods”: (i) by providing a valid credit card, (ii) by using PayPal (as
defined below), or (iii) via in-store credit balances, if applicable (and as defined below), each
a “Payment Method”. For Services that offer “Express Checkout”, clicking the Express
Checkout button will automatically place an order for that Service and charge the primary
Payment Method on file for your Account. Confirmation of that order will be sent to the
email address on file for your Account. Your Payment Method on file must be kept valid if
you have any active Services in your Account. You acknowledge and agree that where
refunds are issued to your Payment Method, Infuzex's issuance of a refund receipt is only
confirmation that Infuzex has submitted your refund to the Payment Method charged at the
time of the original sale, and that Infuzex has absolutely no control over when the refund
will be applied towards your Payment Method’s available balance. You further acknowledge
and agree that the payment provider and/or individual issuing bank associated with your
Payment Method establish and regulate the time frames for posting your refund, and that
such refund posting time frames may range from five (5) business days to a full billing cycle,
or longer. In the event a refund is issued to your Payment Method and the payment
provider, payment processor or individual issuing bank associated with your Payment
Method imposes any limitations on refunds, including but not limited to, limitations as to
the timing of the refund or the number of refunds allowed, then Infuzex, in its sole and
absolute discretion, reserves the right to issue the refund in the form of an in-store credit.
Infuzex also has the right, but not the obligation, to offer an in-store credit for customers
seeking refunds, even if there are no limitations on refunds imposed by the Payment
Method. For the avoidance of doubt, any and all refunds processed via the issuance of instore creditsare solely within Infuzex’s discretion and are not available at customer request.
In order to ensure that you do not experience an interruption or loss of Services, most
Services offer an automatic renewal option. The automatic renewal option automatically
renews the applicable Service for a renewal period equal in time to the most recent service
period, except for domain names which will renew for the original service period. For
example, for products other than domains, if your last service period is for one year, your
renewal period will be for one year. While the details of the automatic renewal option vary 
from Service to Service, the Services that offer an automatic renewal option treat it as the
default setting. Therefore, unless you disable the automatic renewal option, Infuzex will
automatically renew the applicable Service when it comes up for renewal and will take
payment from the Payment Method you have on file with Infuzex at Infuzex’s then current
rates, which you acknowledge and agree may be higher or lower than the rates for the
original service period. In order to see the renewal settings applicable to you and your
Services, simply log into your members area and find the respective account. You may
enable or disable the automatic renewal option at any time. However, should you elect to
disable the automatic renewal option and fail to manually renew your Services before they
expire, you may experience an interruption or loss of Services, and Infuzex shall not be liable
to you or any third party regarding the same. In addition, Infuzex may participate in
“recurring billing programs” or “account updater services” supported by your credit card
provider (and ultimately dependent on your bank’s participation). If you are enrolled in an
automatic renewal option and we are unable to successfully charge your existing Payment
Method, your credit card provider (or your bank) may notify us of updates to your credit
card number and/or expiration date, or they may automatically charge your new credit card
on our behalf without notification to us. In accordance with recurring billing program
requirements, in the event that we are notified of an update to your credit card number
and/or expiration date, Infuzex will automatically update your payment profile on your
behalf. Infuzex makes no guarantees that we will request or receive updated credit card
information. You acknowledge and agree that it is your sole responsibility to modify and
maintain your Account settings, including but not limited to (i) setting your renewal options
and (ii) ensuring your associated Payment Method(s) are current and valid. Further, you
acknowledge and agree that your failure to do so, may result in the interruption or loss of
Services, and Infuzex shall not be liable to you or any third party regarding the same. If for
any reason Infuzex is unable to charge your Payment Method for the full amount owed for
the Services provided, or if Infuzex receives notification of a chargeback, reversal, payment
dispute, or is charged a penalty for any fee it previously charged to your Payment Method,
you agree that Infuzex may pursue all available lawful remedies in order to obtain payment,
including but not limited to, immediate cancellation, without notice to you, of any domain
names or Services registered or renewed on your behalf. Infuzex also reserves the right to
charge you reasonable “administrative fees” or “processing fees” for (i) tasks Infuzex may
perform outside the normal scope of its Services, (ii) additional time and/or costs Infuzex
may incur in providing its Services, and/or (iii) your noncompliance with this Agreement (as
determined by Infuzex in its sole and absolute discretion). Typical administrative or
processing fee scenarios include, but are not limited to (i) customer service issues that
require additional personal time or attention; (ii) UDRP actions(s) in connection with your
domain name(s) and/or disputes that require accounting or legal services, whether
performed by Infuzex staff or by outside firms retained by Infuzex; (iii) recouping any and all
costs and fees, including the cost of Services, incurred by Infuzex as the results of
chargebacks or other payment disputes brought by you, your bank or Payment Method
processor. These administrative fees or processing fees will be billed to the Payment
Method you have on file with Infuzex. Infuzex may offer product-level pricing in various
currencies; however, transaction processing is supported only in U.S. dollars and a select
number of the currency options displayed on this Site ("Supported Currency" or “Supported
Currencies”). If the currency selected is a Supported Currency, then the transaction will be
processed in the Supported Currency and the pricing displayed during the checkout process 
will be the actual amount processed and submitted to your bank for payment. If the
currency selected is not a Supported Currency, then the transaction will be processed in
Indian Rupees and the pricing displayed during the checkout process will be an estimated
conversion price at the time of purchase. In either case (whether the currency selected is a
Supported Currency or not), if the transaction is processed in a currency that differs from
the currency of your bank account, you may be charged exchange rate conversion fees by
your bank. In addition, due to time differences between (i) the time you complete the
checkout process, (ii) the time the transaction is processed, and (iii) the time the transaction
posts to your bank statement, the conversion rates may fluctuate, and Infuzex makes no
representations or warranties that (a) the amount submitted to your bank for payment will
be the same as the amount posted to your bank statement (in the case of a Supported
Currency) or (b) the estimated conversion price will be the same as either the amount
processed or the amount posted to your bank statement (in the case of a non-Supported
Currency), and you agree to waive any and all claims based upon such discrepancies
(including any and all claims for a refund based on the foregoing). In addition, regardless of
the selected currency, you acknowledge and agree that you may be charged Value Added
Tax ("VAT"), Goods and Services Tax ("GST"), or other localized fees and/or taxes, based on
your bank and/or the country indicated in your billing address section.
Refund Policy: Products and Services available for refunds are described here (“Refund
Policy”). For products and services eligible for a refund, you may request a full refund within
thirty (30) days of purchase (“Refund Period”). For refunds requested after the Refund
Period, an in-store credit will be issued for any unused time remaining on your plan. Unused
time will be calculated as the number of months remaining on the purchase term excluding
the month in which the refund is requested. In the event you purchase a product that
includes a free domain name, if you cancel the product, the list price for the domain name
will be deducted from the refund amount. The list price is the price of the domain name
listed on Infuzex’s website and is not subject to any promotion, discount, or other reduction
in price.
In no event will you be eligible for more than one refund of the same product.
(B) INTERNATIONAL PAYMENT OPTIONS
Infuzex offers a variety of alternative international payment options through a variety of
International Payment Providers (“IPP”). In the event you select an IPP, you represent that
you have already agreed to any and all of the IPP’s applicable customer service agreements
in advance of completing your transaction at Infuzex. You also agree to allow the IPP to
debit the full amount of your purchase from the selected bank account, e-wallet account
(including credit card(s), bank account(s), or other allowed payment method(s) linked to
your e-wallet account) or any other type of account associated with the selected IPP
(including but not limited to, prepaid cards and mobile payments), collectively “Funding
Sources”. In addition, you agree to allow the selected IPP to debit, if applicable, an
“Exchange Rate Conversion Fee”, as well as any other fees or charges applicable to your
agreement with the IPP (collectively, the “IPP Fees”), from your Funding Sources. You
understand and agree that IPP Fees are subject to change at any time by the IPP without
notice to you by Infuzex.
It is your responsibility to keep your Funding Sources current and funded. You acknowledge
and agree that (i) the IPP reserves the right to decline a transaction for any reason
(including, but not limited to, payments that fail to go through as a result of your Funding
Sources no longer existing or not holding available/sufficient funds) and (ii) in such event,
neither the IPP nor Infuzex shall be liable to you or any third party regarding the same. You
acknowledge that Infuzex will not attempt to fulfill the Services purchased by you until
Infuzex receives confirmation of payment from the IPP through its associated payment
processor. You acknowledge there may be a gap of several hours or days between the time
you place an order and the time the IPP confirms payment through its associated payment
processor. If Infuzex does not receive confirmation of payment from the IPP through its
associated payment processor within thirty (30) days from when the order is placed, your
order may be cancelled, at which time you will need to commence the purchase process
again. In the event that you would like to cancel payment for a pending transaction, you
may cancel the order through your Infuzex account. Payments received on previously
cancelled orders will be automatically refunded to the original Payment Method when
possible.
If, at the time Infuzex receives confirmation of payment from the IPP (through its associated
payment processor), either (i) the Services (including domain names) are no longer available
for purchase; or (ii) a pending order has been cancelled in our systems; or (iii) the
confirmation of payment does not match the dollar amount of the pending order, and as a
result your purchase is either over-funded or under-funded, Infuzex may automatically issue
a partial refund (in the case of over-funding) or a full refund (in the case of under-funding)
to your Funding Source. If the IPP (or its associated payment processor) imposes refund
limitations of any kind, Infuzex reserves the right to issue refunds to an in-store credit
balance. If you receive a full refund, you will need to begin the purchase process again. You
acknowledge and agree that the IPP reserves the right not to refund IPP Fees associated
with a refunded transaction. Accordingly, any refunds issued by Infuzex will be net of the IPP
Fees unless otherwise specified.
(C) IN-STORE CREDIT BALANCES
In the event that your Account contains an in-store credit balance, you may apply any
available credit balance to any future purchase in your Account. In the event that your
Account contains an in-store credit balance, you hereby authorize Infuzex to apply any
available credit balance to any outstanding administrative fees, chargebacks or other fees
related to your Account. In the event that your default Payment Method fails for an
automated billing in connection with the processing of any Service renewals, Infuzex may
utilize any available in-store credit balance if there are enough funds to cover the entire
transaction. Regardless of the amount of in-store credit available in your account, Infuzex is
not responsible for the loss of products resulting from an inability to collect funds from your
default Payment Methods or the in-store credit. In-store credits will be applied based on the
currency selected in the shopping cart at the time of purchase (or renewal). If you have
more than one in-store credit, then the credits will be processed according to the age of the
credit, with the oldest in-store credit being applied first. If additional funds are required to
complete the purchase or renewal, credits held in a non-selected currency will be converted
using Infuzex’s daily exchange rate based on the age of the credit (oldest to newest) until (i)
enough funds are allocated to complete the transaction, or (ii) there is no available balance
left in your account. You understand and agree that at the time of conversion, Infuzex may 
also impose an additional administrative fee to compensate for the risks and costs
associated with providing currency conversion services.
You can verify your available in-store credit balance at any time by logging into “Manage
Your Account” or through the shopping cart on the Infuzex website. You acknowledge that
in-store credit balances are non-transferrable, may only be used in the Account in which
they were acquired and may expire. Complimentary in-store credits will expire two years
after issuance. In the event that Infuzex terminates your Account, you acknowledge and
agree that any remaining available in-store credit balance will be forfeited.
You also acknowledge that funds available in your in-store credit balance will be held by
Infuzex and will not accrue or pay interest for your behalf. To the extent any interest may
accrue, you understand and agree that Infuzex shall be entitled to receive and keep any
such amounts to cover costs associated with supporting the in-store credit balance
functionality.
